## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: CLEAN CHART, RICH DASHBOARD

Traditional indicators tend to clutter charts with dozens of support/resistance lines, obscuring price action and creating visual noise. This indicator adopts a different approach:

### The Chart:
Renders only the most significant, nearest levels (1 resistance above, 1 support below) that remain unconsumed by price. This keeps your chart streamlined and laser-focused on actionable levels.

### The Dashboard:
Houses all detailed metrics, calculations, and analysis. Rather than plotting 20+ lines across your chart, you receive comprehensive market intelligence in an organized, easy-to-read table format.

### Why This Approach?
- A clean chart enables you to read price action without distraction
- Fewer but more meaningful levels sharpen focus on immediate trade opportunities
- The dashboard delivers analytical depth without compromising chart clarity
- Beginners can develop chart-reading skills with an uncluttered view while accessing in-depth analysis on demand
